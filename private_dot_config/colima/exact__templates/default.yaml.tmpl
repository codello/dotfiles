# Default: colima
#          colima-profile_name for other profiles
hostname: ""

# Auto-activate on the Host for client access.
# Setting to true does the following on startup
#  - sets as active Docker context (for Docker runtime).
#  - sets as active Kubernetes context (if Kubernetes is enabled).
#  - sets as active Incus remote (for Incus runtime).
# Default: true

# Network configurations for the virtual machine.
network:
  # Assign reachable IP address to the virtual machine.
  # NOTE: this is currently macOS only and ignored on Linux.
  # Default: false
  address: false

  # Network mode for the virtual machine (shared, bridged).
  # NOTE: this is currently macOS only and ignored on Linux.
  # Default: shared
  mode: shared

  # Network interface to use for bridged mode.
  # This is only used when mode is set to bridged.
  # NOTE: this is currently macOS only and ignored on Linux.
  # Default: en0
  interface: en0

  # Use the assigned IP address as the preferred route for the VM.
  # Note: this only has an effect when `address` is set to true.
  # Default: false

  # Custom DNS resolvers for the virtual machine.
  #
  # EXAMPLE
  # dns: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]
  #
  # Default: []
  dns: []

  # DNS hostnames to resolve to custom targets using the internal resolver.
  # This setting has no effect if a custom DNS resolver list is supplied above.
  # It does not configure the /etc/hosts files of any machine or container.
  # The value can be an IP address or another host.
  #
  # EXAMPLE
  # dnsHosts:
  #   example.com: 1.2.3.4
  dnsHosts:
    host.docker.internal: host.lima.internal

  # Replicate host IP addresses in the VM. This enables port forwarding to specific
  # host IP addresses.
  #   e.g. `docker run --port 10.0.1.2:8080:8080 alpine` would only forward to the
  #   specified IP address.
  #
  # Default: false

# Forward the host's SSH agent to the virtual machine.

# Docker daemon configuration that maps directly to daemon.json.
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/#daemon-configuration-file.
# NOTE: some settings may affect Colima's ability to start docker. e.g. `hosts`.
#
# EXAMPLE - disable buildkit
# docker:
#   features:
#     buildkit: false
#
# EXAMPLE - add insecure registries
# docker:
#   insecure-registries:
#     - myregistry.com:5000
#     - host.docker.internal:5000
#
# Colima default behaviour: buildkit enabled
# Default: {}

# Virtual Machine type (qemu, vz)
# NOTE: this is macOS 13 only. For Linux and macOS <13.0, qemu is always used.
#
# vz is macOS virtualization framework and requires macOS 13
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: qemu
vmType: vz

# Port forwarder for the virtual machine (ssh, grpc).
# ssh is more stable but supports only TCP.
# grpc supports both TCP and UDP, but is experimental.
#
# Default: ssh
portForwarder: grpc

# Utilise rosetta for amd64 emulation (requires m1 mac and vmType `vz`)
# Default: false

# Enable foreign architecture emulation via binfmt (e.g. amd64 on arm64, arm64 on amd64)
# Default: true

# Enable nested virtualization for the virtual machine (requires m3 mac and vmType `vz`)
# Default: false

# TODO: Enable for work soon-ish

# Volume mount driver for the virtual machine (virtiofs, 9p, sshfs).
#
# virtiofs is limited to macOS and vmType `vz`. It is the fastest of the options.
#
# 9p is the recommended and the most stable option for vmType `qemu`.
#
# sshfs is faster than 9p but the least reliable of the options (when there are lots
# of concurrent reads or writes).
#
# NOTE: value cannot be changed after virtual machine is created.
# Default: virtiofs (for vz), sshfs (for qemu)
mountType: virtiofs

# Propagate inotify file events to the VM.
# NOTE: this is experimental.

# Modify ~/.ssh/config automatically to include a SSH config for the virtual machine.
# SSH config will still be generated in $COLIMA_HOME/ssh_config regardless.
# Default: true
sshConfig: false # Managed by chezmoi

# Configure volume mounts for the virtual machine.
# Colima mounts user's home directory by default to provide a familiar
# user experience.
#
# EXAMPLE
# mounts:
#   - location: ~/secrets
#     writable: false
#   - location: ~/projects
#     writable: true
#
# Colima default behaviour: $HOME is mounted as writable.
# Default: []
mounts: []

# Size of the disk in GiB for the root filesystem of the virtual machine.
# This value is ignored if no runtime is in use. i.e. `none` runtime.
# Default: 20

# Environment variables for the virtual machine.
#
# EXAMPLE
# env:
#   KEY: value
#   ANOTHER_KEY: another value
#
# Default: {}
env: {}
